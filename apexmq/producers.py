    Registers a post-save signal handler to publish specific fields of a model
    instance when a new object is created.

    Args:
        model (Model): The Django model class for which the signal is registered.
        fields (List[str]): A list of field names to extract data from the model instance.
        action (str): The action identifier for the message being published (e.g., 'user.create').
        to (List[str]): A list of queue names where the message will be sent.
        channel_name (str, optional): The name of the channel through which the message
                                      will be published. Defaults to the first channel name
                                      configured in the system.

    Functionality:
        - The function connects a post-save signal to the specified model.
        - When a new instance of the model is created, the specified fields are extracted
          from the model instance.
        - A message is constructed with the extracted fields and sent to the specified
          queues via the `publish` function.

    Example:
        on_model_create(User, ["id", "name"], "user.create", ["queue1", "queue2"])
        - This will send the `id` and `name` fields of a new `User` instance to
          "queue1" and "queue2" when a new user is created.
